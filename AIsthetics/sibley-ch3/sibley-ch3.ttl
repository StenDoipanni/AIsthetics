Where someone tries to bring another to agree with him by reasoning, or by offering rational support for a judgement, he offers statements which, if true, render it certain, likely, or reasonable to suppose, that his judgement was correct. The person to whom the reasons are offered may, after reviewing them, conclude or infer or decide that the judgement is indeed correct or justified. He has been offered reasons for thinking something, and so may end accepting the judgement originally offered. But it was neither the aim nor the outcome of the critic's activity I described to provide reasons from which his audience might reasonably conclude that his judgement was true.""" ;
