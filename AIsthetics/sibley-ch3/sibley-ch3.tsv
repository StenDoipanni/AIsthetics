3		34	"Aesthetics deals with a kind of perception. People have to see the grace or unity of a work, hear the plaintiveness or frenzy in the music, (...). They may be struck by these qualities at once, or they may come to perceive them only after repeated viewings, hearings, or readings, and with the help of critics. But unless they do perceive them for themselves, aesthetic enjoyment, appreciation, and judgement are beyond them. (...); the crucial thing is to see, hear, or feel."	Aesthetic perception	38, 40				Perception is required for aesthetic enjoyment, appreciation and judgement. People cannot make aesthetic judgments unless they perceive for themselves the aesthetic qualities.		Descriptive 		Aesthetics deals with a kind of perception	
3.1		34	"To suppose indeed that one can make aesthetic judgements without aesthetic perception, say, by following rules of some kind, is to misunderstand aesthetic judgement." 	 		Concept 1 is implied in concept 2	Aesthetic judgements		The role of aesthetic perception as the divide between aesthetic and non-aesthetic is reiterated, now specifically referring to aesthetic judgements, and it is raised the point that aesthetic judgements cannot be made by following rules		Progressive-linear

Where there is no question of aesthetic perception, I shall use some other expression like 'attribution of aesthetic quality' or 'aesthetic statement'."

They could no more occur in isolation than there could be facial resemblances without features, or grins without faces; the converse is not true. (ii) The non-aesthetic qualities of a thing determine its aesthetic qualities. Any aesthetic character a thing has depends upon the character of the non-aesthetic qualities it has or appears to have, and changes in its aesthetic character result from changes in its non-aesthetic qualities. Aesthetic qualities are 'emergent'. Like (i) above, which it entails, (ii) concerns the nature of aesthetic properties in general."	Dependence of the aesthetic on the non-aesthetic	37, 45	Concept 1 is implied in concept 2	Emergency	General relationship bewteen aesthetic and non-aesthetic	First two relationships established between aesthetic and non-aesthetic qualities, purely general. Again, the author lays down the basic elements of the analysis before delving into the actual argument.			Adjectival		
		35	(iii) [...] the particular aesthetic character of something may be said to result from the totality of its relevant non-aesthetic characteristics. [...] One might say that it is because everything about the work is exactly as it is—this colour here, that line there, and so on indefinitely—that it is graceful or moving or unbalanced. [...] This third relationship might therefore appropriately be called the relation of total specific dependence.	Total specific dependence					After stating the general relationship of dependence between aesthetic and non-aesthetic qualities, the author elaborates on one of the particular relations existing between them, and names the third relationship "the relation of total specific dependence".			Adjectival		
		36	(iv) The other relationship, the fourth, remains to be considered. A critic frequently tries, as one of his central occupations, to say why a picture is unbalanced, or what gives a complex work its grace, unity, or serenity. [...] In short, what the critic is doing is selecting from a work those features which are notably or especially responsible for its character. For often in a work there are some features that strike us as making the most outstanding contribution, usually those in which a small alteration would work a remarkable aesthetic change. This fourth relationship might therefore be called that of notable specific dependence; statements of such relationships bulk large in criticism. 	Notable specific dependence					The author then elaborates on the fourth relationship, which he names that of "notable specific dependence", and he explains it by referring to the actual work of critics. He points out that one of the central occupations of critics is selecting features that contribute the most to the aesthetic character of the piece considered. This fourth relationship is therefore particularly interesting for his inquiry. The reference to the work of critic is very frequent all throughout the text: it provides a proving groung for the concepts and theses sustained, and makes their comprehension easier for the reader, making the argument more convincing and the flow of the text smoother.			Adjectival		
		37	(i) The relationships that I have just described hold between qualities independently of a person's realizing in particular cases that they do. Whether or not one sees that a picture lacks balance, and lacks it notably because of the placing of a certain figure, in no way bears on the fact that the placing of the figure is what unbalances the picture.	The relationships of dependence exist in things themselves, not simply in the viewer's experience 					The relationship of dependence stands between the qualities themselves, this is an important point that will resurface later while talking about reasons as reasons for things to be the way they are and reasons to infer things are the way they are. This statement about the relationship of dependence standing between things themselves already hints at the fact that reasons in the first sense are the ones that hold according to this analysis.					
		37	This consists largely in showing how aesthetic effects are achieved in a work by isolating and pointing out what is (notably, mainly, in part) responsible. [...] When we see in detail how and why the work has its character, we may find our initial judgement strengthened and trust it more confidently [...] our appreciation is deepened and enriched and becomes more intelligent in being articulate. [...]  Explaining why a work has an aesthetic character, even where the reasons involve mentioning only non-aesthetic features, requires aesthetic discrimination.

		38-39	 a major occupation of critics is the task of bringing people to see things for what, aesthetically, they are, as well as why they are. How a critic manages by what he says and does to bring people to see aesthetic qualities they have missed has frequently puzzled writers. But there is no real reason for mystification. One might puzzle equally over how on my own I come to perceive, after ten minutes in front of a picture or several replayings of a sonata, what I had not previously perceived. A second question about this activity is whether it is a way of supporting orjustifying aesthetic judgements. Some aestheticians have held that this—showng the work, getting people to see—is the only way of supporting an aesthetic judgement, even perhaps the only point of critical activity. [...] I see no reason why it should not be called a way of supporting or justifying, even of proving, an aesthetic judgement	Bringing people to see aesthetic qualities		Concept 1 is an instance of concept 2 	Supporting, justifying or proving aesthetic judgements					Verbal		
		39	 If I say the apples are sour and someone doubts my claim, I may ask him to taste them. With more complex or subtle things I may have to help him in appropriate ways. If I say that a figure can be seen as either a staircase or a cornice, that a cloud looks like a giraffe, that two people look somewhat alike, or that the brandy is soft and velvety, and he questions what I say, it may not be enough merely to invite him to look or taste. I may need to draw attention to this and that, suggest he look at the figure thus, or taste the brandy in a certain way.[...] If he then finds himself agreeing with me, I have vindicated my claim in the best possible way, by getting him to see for himself. There is no reason not to say, if one wishes, that I have supported, justified, or even proved my original judgement. One might refer to this activity therefore, as perceptual proof.	Perceptual proof		Concept 1 is distinguished from concept 2. Concept 1 is valid, concept 2 is not.	Rational support		If we admit the possibility of justification or support for aesthetic judgements, we must clarify that it is not a rational support, one cannot reason in support of an aesthetic judgement. 			Adjectival		
		40	Nevertheless, if we do choose to call this support of an aesthetic judgement, we must be clear what kind it is and what kind it is not. The critic cannot be said to have reasoned in support of it. Where someone tries to bring another to agree with him by reasoning, or by offering rational support for a judgement, he offers statements which, if true, render it certain, likely, or reasonable to suppose, that his judgement was correct. The person to whom the reasons are offered may, after reviewing them, conclude or infer or decide that the judgement is indeed correct or justified. He has been offered reasons for thinking something, and so may end accepting the judgement originally offered. But it was neither the aim nor the outcome of the critic's activity I described to provide reasons from which his audience might reasonably conclude that his judgement was true.	Aesthetic judgements cannot be the outcome of reasons	50	Concept 1 depends on concept 2	Involvement of aesthetic perception in aesthetic judgements		Aesthetic judgements cannot be the outcome of reasons because of the involvement of aesthetic sensitivity in making them: making an aesthetic judgement is not a matter of thinking but one of perceiving aesthetically. Through rational justification one could, at most, make an attribution of aesthetic quality or an aesthetic statement.			Adjectival		
		40	Even if 'perceptual proof* is not a matter of giving reasons, and even if the notion of an aesthetic judgement being the outcome solely of considering reasons is an impossible hybrid, the question must nevertheless be raised whether the aesthetic judgements I am discussing may be justified or supported by reasons in some other way. [...] Could any statements about a thing's non-aesthetic properties alone serve as reasons for agreeing or concluding that it has a certain aesthetic property? [...] How or in what sense then can a judgement be based on reasons given that, in one sense already explained (p, 40), judgements cannot be the outcome of reasons? Perhaps it is a matter of distinguishing two ways of using 'reason'.	Reasons		Concept 1 as justification for concept 2	Aesthetic judgement							
		42	If a work is graceful there will be reasons why it is, and this will be so whether anyone ever knows, or thinks, or has any reasons for thinking it so or not. [...] But 'reason' is also used to mean roughly, a true statement or a fact such that, on the basis of knowing it, it would be reasonable, right, or plausible to infer, suppose, or believe that something is so.	Reasons on an empirical level (reasons something has an aesthetic quality)	50	Concept 1 is distinguished from concept 2. Concept 1 is valid, concept 2 is not.	Reasons on a logical level (reasons to infer something has an aesthetic quality)							
		43	It is, then, a quite unwarranted assumption that, if a critic has noticed or discovered the reasons why something has a certain aesthetic quality and in that sense can cite reasons which support his judgement, he thereby has reasons the citing of which provide rational support for his judgement or show it to be reasonable. A may in fact be the reason why something is B, and yet the knowledge that that thing has A may provide no reason or justification for supposing that it has B.									Nominal		
			(i) First, let me consider certain relationships which do not hold. Although a thing's aesthetic character is dependent on and results from its non-aesthetic features, in general there are no sets of non aesthetic features that are logically sufficient for it to have a certain aesthetic quality. In saying this I mean to exclude several possibilities. There is no one set, no group of sets of logically sufficient conditions, no 'defeasible' sets, and no wholly non-aesthetic descriptions which logically entail a certain aesthetic character or in virtue of which to deny such a character would be a linguistic error. Some qualities of a thing may be sufficient to make it graceful, but it will not be a case of logical sufficiency. No non-aesthetic conditions or descriptions logically require the application, though some may require the rejection, of an aesthetic term. 	Logical sufficiency			Conceptual relationships that hold between aesthetic and non-aesthetic qualities, concepts and judgements					Adjectival		
			(ii) In making this negative claim I have not said that aesthetic concepts are governed by no logical conditions at all. Indeed it is apparent on very little reflection that they are. First, certain non-aesthetic qualities seem to be logically necessary for some aesthetic qualities. Consider gaudy and garish. It seems clear that with only pale pastels and no instances of bright (or apparently bright) colours in existence, there could be no examples of gaudy or garish colouring, and it would be dubious whether anyone could have learned, or whether there would be, any such concepts.	Logical necessity								Adjectival		
			Secondly, some non-aesthetic qualities might be appropriately spoken of as logically presupposed by certain aesthetic qualities. It seems impossible to say of a dot, a flash, or a uniformly coloured surface either that it is or that it is not deeply moving, either that it has or that it lacks grace, unity, or balance. Roughly, only something with line, stance, or movement, or the appearance of such can be graceful or lack grace, and only something consisting of parts in relation can have or lack unity or balance.	Logical presupposition								Adjectival		
			Thirdly, however, there may be a characteristic association or relationship which, though still not merely contingent, is much less stringent than logical necessity of presupposition. Consider 'sad5 as applied to music. Characteristics that typically come to mind are slow tempo, quietness, low pitch, pauses, tailing intervals, minor key, and so on. Gaiety and sprightliness connect similarly with speed, rapid sequences of short notes, and so on.	Characteristic association								Adjectival		
			Thus, if a thing has the aesthetic property A, it may be very likely to have, or may even necessarily have, certain non-aesthetic properties N1, N2, N3, ..., the latter being properties with some conceptual relationship to A. But having the properties N1, N2, N3.. . is no guarantee of A; as far as logical connections go, all one can say is that it may well have A.	General conceptual relationship between aesthetic and non aesthetic qualities										
			I shall take just one of Beardsley's many examples, the connection between slowness and sadness in music, as a typical illustration of his views. The kind of empirical generalization he offers is expressed in several ways: when things have certain qualities they will tend as a result to have another (dependent or emergent) quality; for example, 'music having such and such features (slow tempo, and so on) ... tends to be sad'; certain qualities "tend to make' music sad; these are 'sad-making' qualities, and so on. [...] There are many empirical generalizations one might make connecting aesthetic and non-aesthetic qualities. But many of those that seem true are not of Beardsley's type and are relatively weak—for example, that slow music is sometimes sad and, when it is, is often sad notably because of its tempo. Other statements, like 'sad music is usually slow' may be true too. [...] I do not mean to deny that with care we might produce much more powerful generalizations telling in detail that works with various features always or usually have a certain aesthetic quality. All I have argued is that some tempting generalizations that have been proposed are questionable	Empirical generalizations			Contingent relationships that hold between aesthetic and non-aesthetic qualities, concepts and judgements							
			The question remaining is whether some non-aesthetic statements could by themselves provide, say, a reasonable measure of inductive support for the truth of an aesthetic judgement. Some writers seem to have held that in some such way aesthetic judgements might be adequately and rationally supported, indeed that criticism might in such a way be 'set on a rational basis'.	Justification			A new kind of possible rational support to aesthetic judgemnts		The author poses the question if, through a detailed and hard work of building empirical generalizations, a kind of rational support could be provided for aesthetic judgements. 					
			Now although the generalizations I examined in Section VIII seemed either false or too weak to function thus, with more careful research, it might be argued, we could perhaps provide reliable generalizations that would be at once strong and detailed enough. [...] But if we could,then it is at least conceivable that in the future people might with justified assurance attribute aesthetic properties solely by inference from non-aesthetic features. [...] But this is of limited interest. In so far as people have sought, by empirical research, to provide rational justification generally for aesthetic judgements, claiming that without such justification criticism is unacceptable, the hope is forlorn. [...] For clearly, at least some of the aesthetic judgements from which the investigator began when he set out to establish his generalizations were necessarily without benefit of such justification, and yet had to be accepted as bona fide data.
