1	Dewey	35	experience occurs continuously, because the interaction of live creature and enviroining conditions is involved in the very process of living	experience	vital sense	live creature		here is explained what the author means when he talks about the esperience and he intends to explain what specifically means having an experience			
		36	because of the continuous merging, there are no holes, mechanical junctions and dead centers when we have an experience	work of art	unity	experience		the expeirence is a whole even when it refers to a single experience, the author is looking for a definition of what is definetly an experience.			
2			work of art	is the other term of comparison in addition to the experience							
			in a work of art, different acts, episodes, occurrences melt and fuse into unity, and yet do not disappear and lose their own character as they do so there is a continuous interchange and blending					Dewey compare the work of art with the experience, in both of them there are no holes, no interruption, every part flows.  			
2.1		38	hence an experience of thinking has its own esthetic quality	thinking			esthetic quality	introduction of the consept of the experience of thinking as something that has esthetic quality, also the inteelectual expereince is complete only when it has an esthetic aspect			
			the experience itself has a satisfying emotional quality bacause it possesses internal integration and fullfilment reached through ordered and organised movement	emotional quality	fulfillment	movement		the experience in itself has emotional quality thanks to the organised movement that it has in itself			
2.2			it is possible to be efficient in action and yet not have a conscious experience. the activity is too automatic to permit of a sense of what it is about and where it is going.	action	efficient	unconscious expereince					
					automatic						
2.3		39	the experience may be one that is harmful to the world and its consummation undesiderable. but it has esthetic quality	morality				even if an action is estheic it does not mean that it is moral (for example the concept of the kalon-agathon of the greek culture), but every practical activity has esthetic quality			
				practical activity			esthetic quality				
3		40	when the esthetic appears, it so sharply contrasts with the picture that has been formed of experience, that it is impossible to combine its special qualities with the features of the picture and the esthetic is given an outside place and status.					the esthetic, in an experience, is generally given outside of the experience itself, estheticity can be find out of the framework of experience			
			the enemies of the esthetic are neither the practical nor the intellectual. thy are humdrum, slackness of loose ends; submission to convention in practice and intellectual procedure	enemies 		incoherence		we have ascenrtained that the enemies of the esthetic are not the pratical or the intellectual, because both of them have esthetic qualities in themselfes. the real enemies are all the things that goes in the opposite direction from the unity of an experience (such as humdrum, dissipation, incoherence). 			
3.1		41	every integral experience moves toward a close, an ending, since it ceases only when the energies active in it have done their proper work	integral expereince	ending	work		here there is a resume of what the author has said up to this point: every experience has a closure of a circuit of energy.			
			this closure of a circuit of energy is the opposite of arrest, of stasis	closure	opposite	stasis		the closure of this energy circute is not a stasis of energy.			
			there is an element of undergoing, of suffering in its large sense, in every experience	vital expereince	reconstruction	painful		this element of undergoing, of suffering, is indifferent to the esthetic, every experience has in itself an element that is painful. 			
						undergoing					
			emotions are qualities, whemn they are significant, all emotions are qualifications of a drama and they change ad the drama develops	emotions	significant	qualities		emotions are qualities only when they are significant			
4		42	expereince is emotional but there are no separate things called emotions in it	emotional	separate	emotions		there is not a separation between the emotions in an experience, there are, rather, emotional expereinces. 			
			when the unity is of the sort already described, the expereince has esthetic character even though it is not, dominantly, an esthetic expereince	unity	described	experience	esthetic expereince	when an experience has a unity, despite all the parts of the experience, and the unity is described, the expereince has esthetic carachter			
4.1		43	its nature [the nature of the experience] and import can be expressed only by art, because there is a unity of expereince that can be expressed only as an expereince	art	unity	experience	art	here is made explicit the relation between the experience and the work of art: the unity of the art can be compared with the unity of the experience			the word "esthetic" refers to the experience as appreciative, perceiving, and enjoying. it denotes the consumer's rather than the producer standpoint
					expression						
4.2		43/44	every experience is the result of an interaction between ther live creature and some aspect of the world in which he lives	live creature	experience	world		here is resumed and explained what is, in the end, an experience			
		44	an experience has pattern and structure, because it is not just doing and undergoing in alternation, but consists of them in relationship	doing	relationship	undergoing		the real sense of an experience consist in the relationship of doing and undergoing, and it is what gives the meaning to the experience			
		45	some decisive action is needed in order to estabilish contact with the realities of the world and in order that impressions may be so related to facts that their value is tested and organised	action	contact	realities of the world					
				impressions	relation	tested					
				facts		organised					
			Because perception of relationship between what is done and what is undergone constitutes the work of intelligence, and because the artist is controlled in the process of his work by his grasp of the connection between what he has already done and what he is to do next, the idea that the artist does not think as intently and penetratingly as a scientific inquirer is absurd.	artist	process	work	artist				here is the definition of the esthetic related to the concept of the work of art and the artist, Dewey use it to explain later the relation between the artistic and the experience
						idea					
				doing		undergoing		the artist must know the connection between the doing and the undergoing when he paint to make something that is in relation between what he desire and the effective artwork			
4.3		46	any idea that ignores the role of intelligence in production of works of art is based upon identification of thinking with use of one special kind of material, verbal sign and words	idea	production	work of art	work of art				
				intelligence							
			the production of a work of genuine art probably demands more intelligence than does most of the so-called thinking that goes on among those who pride themselves on being intellectuals	genuine art	demands	intelligence	genuine art	the artist can not be only creative, he has to be also intelligent, every work of art, if it is a good work, has to be made with intelligence			
			esthetic is no intruder in experience from without, but that is the clarified and intensified development of traits that belong to every normally complete esperience	esthetic	no intruder	experience	esthetic				experience and esthetic are strictly interconnected, esthetic complete every experience
			We have no word in the English language that unambiguously includes what is signified by the two words "artistic" and "esthetic." Since "artistic" refers primarily to the act of production and "esthetic" to that of perception and enjoyment, the absence of a term designating the two processes taken together is unfortunate. Sometimes, the effect is to separate the two from each other, to regard art as something superimposed upon esthetic material, or, upon the other side, to an assumption that, since art is a process of creation, perception and enjoyment of it have nothing in common with the creative act.	esthetic		artistic		here there is a distinction between the the artistic, which involves the act of creation, and the esthetic, that involves instead the world of perception, has a relation with the enjoyment of the finished work of art			
				perception		production					
5		47	Every art does something with some physical material, the body or something outside the body, with or without the use of intervening tools, and with a view to production of something visible, audible, or tangible. So marked is the active or "doing" phase of art, that the dictionaries usually define it in terms of skilled action, ability in execution	art	does something	phisical material	art	art has always to do with something phisical and it produces something that can be seen, touched or listened, the act of creation is something that requires skills and abilities in its execution			
				skilled action							
				ability in the execution							
			the word "esthetic" refers to experience as appreciative, perceiving, and enjoying. it denotes the consumer's rather than the producer's standpoint	esthetic	perception	consumer	perception				definition of what is esthetic different from the artistic, the author underlines the perception in the esthetic
			having an experience between doing and undergoing, indicate that the distinction between esthetic and artistic cannot be pressed so far as to become a speration	experience	doing	artistic		there is no a real separation between the esthetic and the artistic because both of them have the quality of doing and undergoing			
				esthetic	undergoing						
					distinction						
5.1		48	to be truly artistic, a work must also be esthetic	artistic	has to be	esthetic					
			art, in its form, unites the very same relation of doing and undergoing, outgoing and incoming energy, that makes an experience to be an experience								here is a corollary of what is the relation between art and esthetic
5.2		49	there is an element of passion in all esthetic perception	passion		esthetic perception					
			the making comes to an end when its result is experienced as good		good result			both in experience and in art we have an end when there is a full satisfaction of senses			
		50	in an emphatic artistic-esthetic experience, the relation is so close that it controls simultaneously both the doing and the perception	emphatic		perception					
			the expression is emotional and guided by purpose	purpose		emotional					
		51	without external embodiement, an experience remains incomplete; physiologically and functionally, sense organs are motor organs and are connected, by means of distribuition of energies in the human body and not merely anatomically, with other motor organs	embodiement	complete	experience		the expereince is not only the idea of a thing, is the embodiement of it, the perception and all the sense organs partecipate in an experience			
				body							
		52	every work of art follows the plan of, and pattern of, a complete experience, rendering it more intensely and concentratedly felt	work of art	complete	part		here is again a mention to the work of art and the fact that it runs to an end, it is complete when all the parts are finished, art and experience have the same energy			
			But receptivity is not passivity. It, too, is a process consisting of a series of responsive acts that accumulate toward objective fulfillment. Otherwise, there is not perception but recognition. The difference between the two is immense. Recognition is perception arrested before it has a chance to develop freely. In recognition there is a beginning of an act of perception. But this beginning is not allowed to serve the development of a full perception of the thing recognized. It is arrested at the point where it will serve some other purpose.	receptivity	purpose	passivity		explanation of what is the difference between receptivity and passivity			
				perception		recognition					
		53	an anct of perception proceeds by waves that extend serially throughout the entire organism. there is, therefore, no such thing in perception as seeing or hearing plus emotion. the perceiived object or scene is emotionally pervaded throughout.	percieved object	perception	emotion		every act of perception is pervaded by emotions			
		54	For to perceive, a beholder must create his own experience. And his creation must include relations comparable to those which the original producer underwent. They are not the same in any literal sense. But with the perceiver, as with the artist, there must be an ordering of the elements of the whole that is in form, although not in details, the same as the process of organization the creator of the work consciously experienced. Without an act of recreation the object is not perceived as a work of art.	experience	creation	consciusly experienced		the act of creation of the experience is necessary. from this point of view  the live creature that experience something has to recreate in the experience a work of art that has already been made.			
				perception	recreation	work of art					
		55	It is not possible to divide in a vital experience the practical, emotional, and intellectual from one another and to set the properties of one over against the characteristics of the others. The emotional phase binds parts together into a single whole; "intellectual" simply names the fact that the experience has meaning; "practical" indicates that the organism is interacting with events and objects which surround it	practical	interaction	experience		the aspects (emotional. practical and intellectual) can not be divided in a vital experience			
				emotional	binds part together						
				intellectual	naming 						
			the experiences in question are dominantly intellectual or practical, rather than distinctively esthetic, because of the interest and purpose that initiate and control them. In an intellectual experience, the conclusion has value on its own account.	intellectual	dominantly	esthetic		the esthetic part of an experience is almost never a whole esthetic experience, it is just another part that is not dominant			
				practical							
			In a distinctively esthetic experience, characteristics that are subdued in other experiences are dominant; those that are subordinate are controlling.		dominant		esthetic experience				here we have the explanation of what in the end is an esthetic experience when the esthetic part is dominant and non submitted to the intellectual or practical
											
		56	That which distinguishes an experience as esthetic is conversion of resistance and tensions, of excitations that in themselves are temptations to diversion, into a movement toward an inclusive and fulfiling close.	resistance	closing movement	esthetic experience					what distinguish an esthetic expereince from another experience: the resistance and the tension
				tension							
			The form of the whole is therefore present in every member. Fulfilling, consummating, are continuous functions, not mere ends, located at one place only. An engraver, painter, or writer is in process of completing at every stage of his work.	form of the whole	continuous process	painter		in a work of art every part of the whole has always a tension in itself, every stage of the work is a process			
				fullfilling		stage of the work					
				consumating							
6		57	An object is peculiarly and dominantly esthetic, yielding the enjoyment characteristic of esthetic perception, when the factors that determine anything which can be called an experience are lifted high above the threshold of perception and are made manifest for their own sake.	object	enjoyment	esthetic					here, in the end of the chapter, we have the last definition of what is an esthetic object and when we can define an object dominantly esthetic and the definition of an experience in itself
