Attached you have four ontologies:
* dewey-ch3.ttl is the ontology taken from expert analysis on aesthetic philosophical vision expressed in 3rd chapter of Dewey's work
* dewey-ch4.ttl is the ontology taken from expert analysis on aesthetic philosophical vision expressed in 4th chapter of Dewey's work
* dewey-ch5.ttl is the ontology taken from expert analysis on aesthetic philosophical vision expressed in 5th chapter of Dewey's work
* aisthetics-core.ttl is a core model for both of them
Your task is to:
1. harmonize them syntactically: if the chapter modules use properties from the core module, use them and do not create duplications
2. harmonize them conceptually: if they express the same concept in different ways, unify it and use the same URI (if it is used in a previous chapter, use the one in previous chapter)
Provide the harmonized modules for chapter 3,4, and 5 separately. 
Print the complete modules, DO NOT eliminate anything which has to be in the final output.
