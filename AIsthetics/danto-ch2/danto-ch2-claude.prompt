Given the core ontology module (aisthetics-core.ttl) and the text of Chapter 2 from Danto, generate a domain-specific module representing the main and most relevant Concepts in Danto's Chapter 2 thought about aesthetic philosophy, linking them to TextualFactoids, neighbour concepts, and so on, following the core ontology. If you need introduce new properties, classes, and semantics in general. Serialize the ontology in Turtle syntax.
