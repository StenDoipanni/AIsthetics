Given the core ontology module (aisthetics-core.ttl) and the text of Chapter 5 from Sibley, generate a domain-specific module representing the main and most relevant Concepts in Sibley's Chapter 5 thought about aesthetic philosophy, linking them to TextualFactoids, neighbour concepts, and so on, following the core ontology. If you need introduce new properties, classes, and semantics in general. Serialize the ontology in Turtle syntax.
