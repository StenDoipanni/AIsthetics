People hitherto used to distinguishing objects, but with black-grey-white or achromatic vision, gradually or suddenly develop colour vision.

    :hasAuthor :Sibley ;
    :findableIn :Page66 ;
    :hasText "Properties like 'square' are entailed by the presence of other ascertainable properties; but 'simple' properties make direct reference to people and their agreement in discrimination, and the language of attribution is tied directly to this.

    :hasText "what I might call an 'ultimate proof (to distinguish it from asking a man already tested for colour vision) would consist in mustering facts so as to show, in a given case, that the conditions are met. To see if the conditions for X being green are met, one could assemble people, test them to see who is now making maximum distinctions, see if they group X with emeralds or grass, and whether they say that grass is green and that it looks as green things always have, etc." ;
