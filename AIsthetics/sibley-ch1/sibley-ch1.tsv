1		1	"I am interested in what they all have in common."	aesthetic concept	p.2-23			the analysis is extended to the "discourse in everyday life", not only works of art	In this first introductory chapter, Sibley is starting to describe what makes an aesthetic concept or term unique in it's use, application, so that we can understand what all aesthetic terms have in common. 			Adjectival			Sibley wants to identify what kind of qualities all aesthetic concepts, that require the ability of taste to be employed, have in common, because "aesthetic terms have been so largely neglected. They have received glancing treatment in the course of other aesthetic discussions; but as a broad category they have not received the direct attention they merit." (see p. 3)
1.1		1	"Accordingly, when a word or expression is such that taste or perceptiveness is required in order to apply it, I shall call it an aesthetic term or expression, and I shall, correspondingly, speak of aesthetic concepts or taste concepts.1"		p. 2-11, p.13, p.14, p. 20-23	concept 2 is entailed in order to apply concept 1	taste	the condition of possibilty of employing aesthetic concepts	When talking about what differentiates aesthetic concepts from other types of descriptions (even of works of art), Sibley says that a certain ability or capacity is implied, which is "taste, perceptiveness, or sensitivity, of aesthetic discrimination or appreciation".		descriptive				
1.2		3	"In short, aesthetic terms always ultimately apply because of, and aesthetic qualities always ultimately depend upon, the presence of features which, like curving or angular lines, colour contrasts, placing of masses, or speed of movement, are visible, audible, or otherwise discernible without any exercise of taste or sensibility."			concept 2 is used to describe concept 1	non-aesthetic terms or concepts	the relationship between the use of aesthetic and non-aesthetic concepts	Sibley analyses the dependence that accures between aesthetic and non-aesthetic terms, namely that non-aesthetics terms are always used to describe aesthetic ones. 						
		13	"It is a characteristic and essential feature of judgements which employ an aesthetic term that they cannot be made by appealing, in the sense explained, to non-aesthetic conditions.9"			the employement of concept 1 cannot be made by using concept 2 conditions									
		4	"there are no non-aesthetic features which serve in any circumstances as logically sufficient conditions for applying aesthetic terms."			concept 2 is not a logically sufficient condition for applying concept 1			The dependence between non-aesthetic and aesthetic terms is not of the A implies B type, A beeing non-aesthetic and B beeing aesthetic terms. 						
1.3		9	"Nothing like this is possible with aesthetic terms. Examples undoubtedly play a crucial role in giving us a grasp of these concepts; but we do not and cannot derive from these examples conditions and principles, however complex, which will enable us, if we are consistent, to apply die terms even to some new cases."			concept 2 isn't used to state concept 1	rules, conditions and principles								
1.4		20	"Aesthetic concepts are as natural, as little esoteric, as any others."			concept 1 doesn't involve concept 2	unnatural, esoteric language and use								Sibley argues against a commun misconception, according to which aesthetic concepts and qualities pertain to a very specific, esoteric domain. Sibley thinks that this isn't true, aesthetic concepts just have different rules, contexts and aren't as straight-forward as the non-aesthetic ones.
1.5		2	"Having entered the language of art description and criticism as metaphors they are now standard vocabulary in that language."		p.20 	concept 2 is sometimes involved with the making with concept 1 but once concept 1 is formed concept 2 doesn't serve it's usual purpose	metaphors	the process that makes it possible to use an aesthetic concept or description							Sibley argues that for us to use an aesthetic word or concept there should be a sort of trasfert of meaning, from a literal to a quasi or metaphorical sense, that leads us to ufficially use an aesthetic concept in it's proper, specific and natural sense.
2		4	"Aesthetic or taste concepts are not in this respect condition-governed at all."	condition-governed		concept 1 is NOT involved with concept 2	aethetic concept		Sibley here finds that one of the things that makes an aesthetic description, is the fact that it's not logically governed by necessary and sufficient conditions of any type. 		descriptive, linear				
		5	"There are no sufficient conditions, no non-aesthetic features such that the presence of some set or numbers of them will beyond question logically justify or warrant the application of an aesthetic term."												
		4	"In recent times philosophers have broken the spell of the strict necessary-and-sufficient model by showing that many everyday concepts are not of that type. Instead, they have described various other types of concepts which are governed only in a much looser way by conditions. However, since these newer models provide satisfactory accounts of many familiar concepts, it might plausibly be thought that aesthetic concepts are of some such kind and that they similarly are governed in some looser way by conditions. I want to argue that aesthetic concepts differ radically from any of these other concepts."							Sibley uses a recurring phenomenon in recent philosophy only to state that his object of analysis differs even from this.	dialectic				
			"These instances where there appear to be rules are peripheral cases of the use of aesthetic terms"			concept 1 is sometimes involved in stating concept 2, but it's an exception to the rule, a peripheral case					dialectic				
2.1		6	"I do not wish to deny therefore that taste concepts may be governed negatively by conditions."		p. 8, p.13	concept 2 is the exception of concept 1	condition-governed, negatively								
3		9	"It is at least noteworthy that in applying words like 'lazy' or 'intelligent' to new and unique instances we say that we are required to exercise judgement; it would be indeed odd to say that we are exercising taste. In exercising judgement we are called upon to weigh the pros and cons against each other, and perhaps sometimes to decide whether a quite new feature is to be counted as weighingon one side or on the other. But this goes to show that, although we may learn from and rely upon samples and precedents rather than a set of stated conditions, we are not out of the realm of general conditions and guiding principles. These precedents necessarily embody, and are used by us to illustrate, a complex web of govern- ing and relevant conditions which it is impossible to formulate completely. To profit by precedents we have to understand them; and we must argue consis- tently from case to case. This is the very function of precedents. Thus it is possible, even with these very loosely condition-governed concepts, to take clear or paradigm cases of x and to say 'this is x because ...', and follow it up with an account of features which logically clinch the matter. Nothing like this is possible with aesthetic terms"	taste		concept 2 is in contrast to concept 1	judgement	different types of human abilities emplyed for different types of purposes	Sibley uses some exemples, like the concepts of "lazy" and "intelligent" to prove the difference between the exercise of judgement, employed in non-aesthetic contexts, and the exercise of taste, employed in aesthetic concepts. The first types of descriptions are founded upon conditions while it doesn't work the same way for the others. 						
3.1		14	"This kind of comparison between the exercise of taste and the use of the five senses is indeed familiar; our use of the word 'taste' itself shows that the comparison is age-old and very natural. Yet whatever the similarities, there are great dissimilarities too."			concept 2 and concept 1 have great similarities but great dissimilarities too	perception; the use of the five senses				dialectic				
4		3	"When we cannot ourselves quite say what non-aesthetic features make something delicate or unbalanced or powerful or moving, the good critic often puts his finger on something which strikes us as the right explanation."	the critic	p. 16, p.18, p.19	analysing and pointing out concept 2 is the prerogative of concept 1 	aesthetic concepts 								it is the role of the critic of pointing out aesthetic concepts and qualities
4.1		18	"I shall attempt a brief description of the methods we use as critics."		p.19	concept 1 uses concept 2 to operate 	the method		Sibley describes the method used by critics, that already have a clear grasp of what aesthetic qualities are, to point them out to the general public. He sums the method up in 7 main points or steps (see p. 18 and p.19). 						
4.2		23	"But in particular I have wanted to urge that it should not strike us as puzzling that the critic supports his judgements and brings us to see aesthetic qualities by pointing out key features and talking about them in the way he does. It is by the vary same methods that people helped us develop our aesthetic sense and master its vocabulary from the beginning."				the normal learning of aesthetic concepts' use
