You are a knowledge engineer modeling the domain of aesthetic philosophy. You will generate a comprehensive knowledge graph from the following philosophical text analysis materials:

1. Core OWL Ontology: this provides the Core module to which the domain-specific module must be aligned. (attached as "aisthetics-core.ttl")

2. TSV Data File: this contains the manual analysis from a domain expert about Sibley. (attached as "sibley-ch1.tsv"). 
Note that the core ontology matches the columns of the tsv.


3. Additional Materials (not mandatory):
- Original Text: the original 1st chapter of Sibley's excerpt/chapter analysed.
- Visual Diagrams: a diagram made by the domain expert to support the analysis.

Please:

a) First analyze and validate the correspondence between:
- TSV column structure and ontology properties
- Concepts in the text and their representation in the TSV
- Cross-references and inheritance patterns in the data

b) Create a visualization in mermaid of the knowledge graph showing:
- Main concepts and their hierarchies
- All relationships between TextualFactoids
- Complete reference chains and inherited properties
- Clear indication of style categories
- All cross-references resolved and explicitly shown

c) Generate the corresponding RDF in Turtle syntax that:
- Follows the core ontology structure
- Includes all data from the TSV
- Maintains all cross-references
- Preserves complete text content
- Documents any assumptions or interpretations made

Please highlight any:
- Ambiguous references that need resolution
- Inherited properties through reference chains
- External references that need special handling
- Complex relationships that may need clarification

The goal is to create a reusable, well-documented knowledge graph that accurately represents the philosophical analysis while maintaining the structural integrity defined by the core ontology.
