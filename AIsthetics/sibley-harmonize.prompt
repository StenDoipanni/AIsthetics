Attached you have four ontologies:
* sibley-ch1.ttl is the ontology taken from expert analysis on aesthetic philosophical vision expressed in 1st chapter of Sibley's work
* sibley-ch3.ttl is the ontology taken from expert analysis on aesthetic philosophical vision expressed in 3rd chapter of Sibley's work
* sibley-ch5.ttl is the ontology taken from expert analysis on aesthetic philosophical vision expressed in 5th chapter of Sibley's work
* aisthetics-core.ttl is a core model for both of them
Your task is to:
1. harmonize them syntactically: if the chapter modules use properties from the core module, use them and do not create duplications
2. harmonize them conceptually: if they express the same concept in different ways, unify it and use the same URI (if it is used in a previous chapter, use the one in previous chapter)
Provide the harmonized modules for chapter 1,3, and 5 separately. 
Print the complete modules, DO NOT eliminate anything which has to be in the final output.
